## Name
Text-Based RPG

## Description
Our Text-Based RPG is an offline singleplayer experience where you play as an adventurer exploring a medieval world with magical beasts, warriors, and dragons to defeat! You can choose to follow different class paths to visit different locations and retrieve different class-specific items. You can follow the melee class and learn the ways of warriors, the ranged class and learn the ways of archers, the mage class and learn the ways of wizards, or the rogue class and learn the ways of thieves. Once complied into a runnable .jar file, it can be played in the terminal using number inputs to choose paths to go down. All data is saved locally on your computer so no internet is needed.
